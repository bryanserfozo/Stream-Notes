# Thread Pooling
Server Programs such as database and web servers repeatedly execute requests from multiple clients and these are oriented around processing a large number of short tasks. An approach for building a server application would be to create a new thread each time a request arrives and service this new request in the newly created thread. While this approach seems simple to implement, it has significant disadvantages. A server that creates a new thread for every request would spend more time and consume more system resources in creating and destroying threads than processing actual requests.

A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing. Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.

- Java provides the Executor framework which is centered around the Executor interface, its sub-interface â€“ExecutorService and the class-ThreadPoolExecutor, which implements both of these interfaces. By using the executor, one only has to implement the Runnable objects and send them to the executor to execute.

- Executor Thread Pool Methods

```java
newFixedThreadPool(int) // Creates a fixed size thread pool
newCachedThreadPool() // Creates a thread pool that creats new threads as needed,
                      // but will resuse previously constructed threads that are available
newSingleThreadExecutor() // Creates a single thread
```

# Stream API
The Java 8 [Stream API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) is a functional-style way of defining operations on a stream of elements. Streams are an abstraction which allow defining operations which do not modify the source data and are lazily executed. Streams **do not store data**, they simply define operations like filtering, mapping, or reducing, and can be combined with other operations and then executed. Some built-in `Stream`s are located in the `java.util.stream` package.

Streams are divided into *intermediate* and *terminal* operations. Intermediate streams return a new stream and are always lazy - they don't actually execute until a terminal operation is called. Terminal operations trigger the execution of the stream pipeline, which allows efficiency by perfoming all operations in a single pass over the data.

Finally, reduction operations take a sequence of elements and combine them into a single result. Stream classes have the `reduce()` and `collect()` methods for this purpose, with many built-in operations defined in the `Collectors` class.

```java
List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
// add students...
List<Double> grades = students.stream()
                          .filter(s -> s.isAttending())
						  .mapToDouble(s -> s.getGrade)
						  .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## Optional Class
[The `Optional` class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html) was introduced in Java 8 to reduce the need for excessive `null` value checking. An `Optional` is a kind of wrapper object which may or may not contain a value, with a few helper methods to handle existing or non-existent values (see Javadocs above).

Optionals are useful as replacements for `null` values when returning an "empty" response from a method. For example:

```java
public class OptionalExample {
  public Optional<String> getAmbiguousString(boolean b) {
    if (true) {
	  return Optional.of("awesome string!");
	} else {
	  return Optional.empty();
	}
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Optional<String> optString = getAmbiguousString(false);
	String theString = optString.orElse(""); // specify a fallback value
	System.out.println(theString);
	// we can use the String without fear of NullPointerException now
  }
}
```
