# Project 1.5
For Project 1.5, you will be reworking your Project 1 by: making it a Maven Project, adding a data/persistance layer, and writing a suite of unit tests. Using SQL Workbench, you will design a structured, relational database that will store all necessary data for your application to function. JUnit will be the tool used to write unit tests to validate/verify the functionality of your app.

# Minimum Features (MVP)
This iteration of your project must have: 
1. Everything required of Project 1
    - if you did not complete all of your user stories from the first project, continue to implement them in this project. 
2. All data is persisted in a relational database. 
3. Data in two of your tables must relate using foreign key constraints. 
4. Database must have at least 3 tables.
5. Each service class method must have at least 2 unit tests.
